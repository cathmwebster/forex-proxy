TODO document about possible exceptions
## Application features
TODO just some ideas for now
- If I know the rate of AC and the rate of AB, how do I get CB = AC * 1/AB
  - Convert rates using JPY as the middle rate ex) USD -> JPY -> AUD
      - JPYUSD = 0.00867877, AUDJPY = 0.0124126, USDAUD = 1.43023
      - USDAUD = 1/0.00867877 * (0.0124126) = 1.43022571
- Use caffeine lib for cache https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine
  - store every JPYXXX pair rates in the cache
  - cache should expire after 5 minutes
  - if the rate is not available in the cache, fetch from one frame api and update cache
  - distributed cache is ideal but will skip it for now
- Use enum to store currency values, validate that to != from
- Errors
  - 400 for unsupported currency, missing parameter
  - 500 when data can't be fetched, etc.
- Issues with caching (probably won't have time to work on it but will leave notes)
  - if we cannot update the currency values due to one frame api error, the cache will be evicted
  - what if one frame api returns rates that are older than 5 minutes
  - we can keep a timestamp of when the data was fetched, the time_stamp response from one frame, and expire at
  - we could instead keep the value in the cache, but update expire time by +5 minutes (?)
  - how do we test this cache...
